# The set of rewrite rules in this file is partially for illustration, and
# partially for filtering ad requests.  I also have a hosts file that
# redirects known ad servers to my local machine, as per
# http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm . 
#
# This rewrite rule file redirects the ad requests to the local machine, to a
# "filtered.htm" file.  You drop the "filtered.htm"  into c:\inetsrv\wwwroot and
# you can put anything you like into the filtered.htm  file.  It will display for 
# every filtered ad.
